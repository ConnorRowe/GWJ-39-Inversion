## About
You wake up in a strange world as a weird little tortilla chip shaped automaton. You have the power to invert the element of certain objects. Use this to complete puzzles.

## Controls

    A - Left
    D - Right
    Space or W - Jump
    Left Mouse - Spawn Orb
    R - Reset level
    Escape or P - Pause
    F11 - Toggle fullscreen

## Note:
If playing in the browser you may experience some bad audio lag as well as some particles not displaying. So I recommend downloading if your system isn't powerful enough (or if you have a thousand tabs open).
